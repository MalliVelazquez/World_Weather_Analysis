# World_Weather_Analysis
 
For this project we created a random data set so people can choose vacation destinations intended for people who are bicycle commuters since this type of adventure is becoming very popular in young adults but could be apply for driving adventurers too. All this according to the weather preferences of the users

## Resources

- We create a random 2000 latitudes and longitudes so nearest places with minimum & maximum temperature preferences apply by users result. 
- Software used: Python 3.9.11, Anacoda 4.11, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6
- APIs from OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps

## Results

As we can see bellow, since user apply 86°F to 95°F many cities have came as result.

Since Mexico and United states are, for us, the target, we use some cities that are less popular so travelers and adveturers can discover new cities non popular and their attractions. 
For that porpuse we selected four cities in United states near Mexican frontier so bicycle commuters can find a delimitated rute and Hotel's information so they can delimitate their trip and make a budget for that.  

* Bellow our suggested rute:

* Finally, as said above, our main concern in this kind of travelers is them to get a budget, a plan and a rute so we deliver suggested Hotels in that cities:

With all this we hope to get more travelers in suggested hotels getting more bookings and increasing turism in less popular cities.
